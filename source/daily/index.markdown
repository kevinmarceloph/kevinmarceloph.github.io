_This is the page I visit every day to reorient myself. I also have a small whiteboard where I write my changing goals everyday and a private daily log of noteworthy acts and events._


## Remember:
1. **It's okay to fail:** It's not the end of the world, so swallow the bitter pill and get ready for your next shot.
2. **But aim to win:** All your knowledge and clarity of thought is maintained for one purpose: to serve as your strategy and tactics to win this game called life.
3. **Take time to think:** There are connections waiting to happen if you just stop and think. Take walks, stretch your muscles, carry your mind back to your brain.

## Goals:
1. **Work:** Deliver on my day job and help reach the company's goals.
2. **Projects:** Start turning my ideas into projects and set them out into the wild.
3. **Writing:** Become a good writer, and consequently a smarter reader/consumer.
4. **Fitness:** Track my weight and start losing it, pick up a sport, be able to run 5k.
5. **Happiness:** Become happier / less sad by managing finances (and other stresses) well, looking for new experiences (travel, friends, knowledge).
6. (plus the other goals you must avoid at all cost)

## Schedule:
