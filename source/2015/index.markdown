_2015 will be a great year of work, projects, writing, fitness and happiness (through buys/savings, cooking and travel)._

## Goals (2015 version):
1. **Work:** Deliver on my day job and help reach the company's goals.
2. **Projects:** Start turning my ideas into projects and set them out into the wild.
3. **Writing:** Become a good writer, and consequently a smarter reader/consumer.
4. **Fitness:** Track my weight and start losing it, pick up a sport, be able to run 5k.
5. **Happiness:** Become happier / less sad by managing finances (and other stresses) well, looking for new experiences (travel, friends, knowledge).
