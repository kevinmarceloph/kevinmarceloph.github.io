Hello world! I am Kevin Marcelo, a follower of multiple passions. I previously describe myself as a jack of all trades, but I don't have a good list of trades to be a jack of. So, in the spirit of "follow your passion," I follow multiple passions.

I have [a lot of ideas](/ideas/) waiting to be brought to life, and I'm on a long journey to [finally executing them](/projects/). I am a full stack-ish web developer (Python + Django + basic front end + basic server), and while I try to [keep myself updated](/technology/) with new technologies, I care more about picking up [the other skills](/not-technology/) needed to make full products.

Outside ideas and projects, I am also a trope enthusiast. I've long thought myself as [_otaku_](/anime/), [gamer](/games/), [reader](/books/) and [cinemaphile](/movies/) combined (plus some [TV series](/tv/) and [comic books](/comics/)), but now I understand that what I get from them are the plots and patterns, more known now as tropes. This also explains why I spread myself across many media instead of focusing on one, and also why I play games for their narratives. TV Tropes has ruined my life, and that's good.

I also care a lot about rationality, both in the sense of [getting my beliefs straight](/beliefs/) and using my knowledge [to achieve my goals](/winning/). (As "rationality" can mean someting completely different to you, I recommend you read [my favorite piece of literature](/hpmor/), Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality.) I also care about expressing my points with [the sharpness of knives](/clarity/), which I cannot reliably do yet, as I'm [not a good writer](/writing/) yet in general.

I am also human, so I also want to [get fit](/fitness/), [cook good food](/cooking/), [see the world](/travel/), and many more ([25 of them in total](/goals/)). I probably cannot do all of them, but I want to get as far as I can, ticking off a few a time.
